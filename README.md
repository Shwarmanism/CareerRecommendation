# 🚀 CAREER RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

The Career Recommendation System is designed to help students make informed career choices by analyzing their personal attributes, interests, and other key factors. The system employs machine learning algorithms to generate personalized career recommendations based on user data collected from the questionnaire.

## SYSTEM WORKFLOW

The system follows a structured workflow consisting of the following key processes:

### Data Collection
- The system gathers user data through a series of questions that focus on personality type, skills, interests, and other relevant factors. Once the data is collected, it is sorted and processed using our recommendation algorithm to ensure accurate and meaningful career suggestions.

### Recommendation Model
- Our model uses the RandomForestClassifier, as it achieved the highest accuracy among our evaluated algorithms. By applying RandomForestClassifier, the system effectively sorts and classifies user data, allowing it to generate career recommendations tailored to the user’s responses.

### Expected Output
- Based on the collected information, the system predicts a suitable career path for the user, providing a recommendation that aligns with their profile and preferences.

## 🎨 GUI USAGE
   The program features a user-friendly interface that guides users through the career recommendation process. Upon launching the application, users can initiate the system by clicking a button. They are then directed to a form where they must enter the required information using a series of text fields and dropdown boxes. Once the necessary data is submitted through a button, the system processes the input, and after a brief loading period, it displays the recommended career field based on the analysis.

## ⚙️ Usage (Abstract Implementation)
   In the implementation of abstraction, we utilized the abstraction by using it to categorize the different fields. starting with the abstract class CareerField, this sets up the format of the rest of the 
   subclasses with field(), recommendationCourse(), jobOpportunities(), and otherInfo() as its abstract methods. Each field subclass then has their information placed into these methods, 
   by having them inherit CareerField. A career field is then selected using the switch statement to display its information for the user when it makes its recommendation.
   - Abstract Class Implementation
     ```bash
      abstract class CareerField{
       public abstract String field();
      }
   - Subclass Implemented Example
     ```bash
      class LawField extends CareerField{
          public String field(){
              return "Recommend Law and Legal Services!\n" +
              "Includes lawyers, judges, paralegals, and legal consultants.\n";
          } 
      }
